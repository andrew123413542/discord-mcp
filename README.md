  Connecting to Discord

  ✔ Authenticated as MyBot#1234
    Application ID: 123456789
    Servers: 2 found
```

It will:
1. Guide you through creating a Discord bot (or use an existing one)
2. Validate your bot token live
3. Auto-generate the invite URL with all required permissions
4. Let you pick which server to manage
5. Auto-detect your installed MCP clients and write the config for you

### Works With Every MCP Client

The wizard auto-detects which clients you have installed:

```
  Detected MCP clients:

  ● Claude Code      .mcp.json
  ● Claude Desktop   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
  ● Cursor           ~/.cursor/mcp.json
  ○ Windsurf         (not detected)

  ? Which client(s) to configure?
  1. Claude Code (detected)
  2. Claude Desktop (detected)
  3. Cursor (detected)
  4. Windsurf (not found)
  5. All detected (3 clients)
  6. Skip (show config to copy manually)
```

Select one, multiple, or "All detected" to configure everything at once.

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp check

## What Can You Do With It?

Once connected to Claude Code, just ask in natural language:

- *"Send a welcome message in #general"*
- *"Lock down the #announcements channel"*
- *"Who reacted to the last message in #server-guide?"*
- *"Create a role called VIP with a gold color and assign it to @john"*
- *"Show me the audit log for the last 24 hours"*
- *"Set up an automod rule to block links in #general"*
- *"Create a forum post in #feedback titled Bug Reports"*
- *"Timeout @spammer for 1 hour for spamming"*
- *"List all webhooks and delete the unused ones"*
- *"Schedule a community event for Friday at 8pm in the Stage channel"*
- *"Bulk delete the last 50 messages in #bot-testing"*
- *"Give everyone with the Member role access to #private-channel"*
- *"Create a poll in #general asking which game to play Friday"*
- *"DM all moderators about the upcoming server event"*
- *"Set the bot's status to 'Watching over 500 members'"*
- *"Show me who's in the Gaming voice channel right now"*

Claude automatically resolves channel, role, and member names using fuzzy matching — no need to look up IDs.

## Features

- **134 tools across 20 categories** — comprehensive Discord server administration without leaving the terminal
- **Interactive setup wizard** — `npx init` walks you through bot creation, token validation, and config in under a minute
- **Health check & permission audit** — `npx check` verifies your token, server access, and all 24 required permissions with a visual progress bar
- **Fuzzy name resolution** — type `"bot testing"`, `"bot-testing"`, or `"bottesting"` and it resolves correctly; no need to look up IDs
- **Zero-config name matching** — channels, roles, and members are all resolved by name, ID, or mention format automatically
- **Pre-cached server data** — all channels, roles, and members are cached on startup for instant lookups without extra API calls
- **Structured JSON responses** — every tool returns consistent, pretty-printed JSON
- **Audit log integration** — all modifying operations accept a `reason` parameter that appears in the Discord audit log
- **Helpful error recovery** — failed lookups return suggestions (e.g., "Did you mean: #general, #bot-testing?")
- **MCP resources** — three read-only resources for server overview data

## Alternative Setup (Manual)

If you prefer to configure things manually instead of using the wizard:

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup steps</strong></summary>

### 1. Create a Discord bot

Follow the [Bot Setup Guide](docs/bot-setup-guide.md) to create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal and get your token.

### 2. Add to your MCP config

Add the following `discord` entry to your client's config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@quadslab.io/discord-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "your-bot-token",
        "DISCORD_GUILD_ID": "your-server-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Client | Config file location |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `.mcp.json` in your project root |
| **Claude Desktop** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

### 3. Connect

- **Claude Code:** Type `/mcp` to connect
- **Claude Desktop:** Restart the app
- **Cursor / Windsurf:** Reload the window

## Fuzzy Matching

All tools that accept channel, role, or member names use smart fuzzy matching. You never need to look up IDs manually. The resolution order is:

1. **Exact ID match** — pass a Discord snowflake ID directly
2. **Exact name match** — case-insensitive
3. **Normalized match** — ignores hyphens, spaces, and underscores (`"bot testing"` matches `"bot-testing"`)
4. **Substring match** — partial name matches at 0.7+ similarity threshold

Mention formats are also handled automatically:

- Channels: `#name` or `<#id>`
- Roles: `@name` or `<@&id>`
- Members: `@name` or `<@id>` or `<@!id>`

If no match is found, the error message includes suggestions of similar names to help you correct the input.

---

## MCP Resources

Three read-only resources are exposed for quick server overview data:

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `discord://server/summary` | Text overview of the server (channels, roles, members) |
| `discord://server/channels` | JSON list of all channels organized by category |
| `discord://server/roles` | JSON list of all roles sorted by position |

---

## Required Permissions

The Discord bot needs the following permissions for full functionality:

| Category | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| **General** | Manage Server, Manage Roles, Manage Channels, View Audit Log, Manage Webhooks, Manage Events, Manage Emojis and Stickers |
| **Text** | Send Messages, Manage Messages, Read Message History, Add Reactions, Use External Emojis |
| **Voice** | Move Members, Disconnect Members |
| **Moderation** | Kick Members, Ban Members, Moderate Members, Manage Auto Moderation |

The `init` wizard auto-generates an invite URL with all of these. If you set up manually, see the [Bot Setup Guide](docs/bot-setup-guide.md) for which checkboxes to select.

The bot can only act within its role hierarchy — it cannot manage roles positioned higher than its own highest role.

### Gateway Intents

These privileged intents must be enabled in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

- **Server Members Intent** — required for member management
- **Message Content Intent** — required for reading message content

---

## Troubleshooting

Run the health check to diagnose issues:

```bash
npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp check
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Common issues and fixes</strong></summary>

### "DISCORD_TOKEN is not set"

The MCP server can't find your bot token. Either:
- Run `npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp init` to set up automatically
- Or check that your `.mcp.json` / MCP client config has the `DISCORD_TOKEN` in the `env` block

### "Request with opcode 8 was rate limited"

Discord rate-limited the gateway connection (usually from member caching on large servers). The server retries automatically — if you're still seeing this, wait 30 seconds and try again. This is a Discord-side limit, not a bug.

### "Role @everyone not found"

Fixed in v1.2.2+. Update to the latest version:
```bash
npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp@latest init
```

### "Missing Access" or "Missing Permissions"

The bot's role doesn't have the required permissions. Either:
- Re-invite the bot using the URL from `npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp init` (it includes all permissions)
- Or go to **Server Settings > Roles** and grant the missing permissions to the bot's role
- Run `npx @quadslab.io/discord-mcp check` to see exactly which permissions are missing

### Bot can't manage a specific role

Discord enforces role hierarchy — the bot can only manage roles **below** its own highest role. Move the bot's role higher in **Server Settings > Roles**.

### Bot can't read messages

Enable **Message Content Intent** in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) > Bot tab.

### "Used disallowed intents"

Enable **Server Members Intent** and **Message Content Intent** in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) > Bot tab. Both are required.

### Tools work but are slow

The first tool call after startup may be slow due to caching. Subsequent calls use the cached data and should be instant. If all calls are slow, check your network connection to Discord.

### `.mcp.json` was created in the wrong directory

If you ran `init` from Desktop or Downloads, update to v1.2.3+ which auto-detects this and writes to `~/.claude.json` (global config) instead. Or move the `.mcp.json` file to your project root.
