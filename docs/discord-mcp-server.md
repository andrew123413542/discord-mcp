# Discord MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides full Discord server administration through Claude Code. Built with Discord.js v14 and the MCP SDK, it exposes 99 tools covering every aspect of server management — from sending messages and managing roles to configuring auto-moderation rules, forums, stages, and scheduled events.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A Discord bot token with appropriate permissions
- The bot must be invited to the target server with the necessary OAuth2 scopes (`bot`, `applications.commands`)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Yes | Your Discord bot token (also accepts `BOT_TOKEN` as fallback) |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Yes | The ID of the Discord server to manage |

These are loaded from a `.env` file via `dotenv`.

### Running

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Start standalone
npm run mcp:start
# or
node dist/mcp-server.js
```

### Claude Code Integration

The server is configured in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/mcp-server.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/QuadsLabBot"
    }
  }
}
```

Reconnect with `/mcp` in Claude Code after any changes.

### Key Design Features

- **Fuzzy matching**: All channel, role, and member parameters are fuzzy-matched. You can type `"bot testing"`, `"bot-testing"`, or `"bottesting"` and it resolves correctly. Exact ID matches are also supported.
- **Server cache**: On startup, the server pre-caches all channels, roles, and members for instant fuzzy lookups without API calls.
- **Consistent JSON responses**: Every tool returns structured, pretty-printed JSON.
- **Audit log integration**: All modifying operations accept a `reason` parameter that appears in the Discord audit log.
- **Error recovery**: Failed lookups return helpful suggestions (e.g., "Did you mean: #general, #bot-testing?").

### Gateway Intents

The bot connects with these intents:

- `Guilds` — server structure (channels, roles)
- `GuildMembers` — member data and events
- `GuildMessages` — message content and events
- `GuildModeration` — ban and kick events
- `MessageContent` — read message text
- `GuildMessageReactions` — reaction data
- `GuildScheduledEvents` — scheduled event management
- `AutoModerationConfiguration` — automod rule management
- `GuildWebhooks` — webhook events
- `GuildInvites` — invite tracking

## Fuzzy Matching

All tools that accept channel, role, or member names use smart fuzzy matching. The resolution order is:

1. **Exact ID match** — pass a Discord snowflake ID directly
2. **Exact name match** — case-insensitive
3. **Normalized match** — ignores hyphens, spaces, and underscores (`"bot testing"` matches `"bot-testing"`)
4. **Substring match** — partial name matches at 0.7+ similarity threshold

Mention formats are also handled automatically:
- Channels: `#name` or `<#id>`
- Roles: `@name` or `<@&id>`
- Members: `@name` or `<@id>` or `<@!id>`

If no match is found, the error message includes suggestions of similar names.

## Permissions

The Discord bot needs the following permissions in the server for full functionality:

- **General**: Manage Server, Manage Roles, Manage Channels, View Audit Log, Manage Webhooks, Manage Events, Manage Emojis and Stickers
- **Text**: Send Messages, Manage Messages, Read Message History, Add Reactions, Use External Emojis
- **Voice**: Move Members, Disconnect Members
- **Moderation**: Kick Members, Ban Members, Moderate Members, Manage Auto Moderation

The bot can only act within its role hierarchy — it cannot manage roles higher than its own.
